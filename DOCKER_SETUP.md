# Docker Build Setup - Summary

âœ… **Completed Setup for Model-Free Docker Builds**

## What We've Done

1. **Updated `.dockerignore`**
   - Excludes `models/` directory (currently a symlink to `/mnt/fast/models`)
   - Excludes all model file types (`*.safetensors`, `*.bin`, `*.ckpt`, etc.)
   - Excludes development files, test files, and output directories
   - Keeps Docker image size minimal (~8-12GB instead of 100GB+)

2. **Fixed Dockerfile**
   - Uses CUDA 12.0.1 base image (compatible with PyTorch)
   - Sets proper cache directories (`HF_HOME`, `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE`, `TORCH_HOME`)
   - Optimized for RunPod serverless deployment
   - Creates necessary directories for model downloads

3. **Created Build Scripts**
   - `scripts/test_build.sh` - Tests Docker build without models
   - `scripts/build_and_push.sh` - Builds and pushes to GCR
   - `scripts/docker-wrapper.sh` - Handles DOCKER_HOST issues

4. **Added Documentation**
   - `docs/docker-deployment.md` - Complete deployment guide
   - Covers local development with volume mounts
   - RunPod serverless configuration
   - Environment variables and troubleshooting

## Key Features

- **Local Development**: Models stay in local `models/` symlink
- **Production**: Fresh model downloads in container from HuggingFace
- **Flexibility**: Can use volume mounts for model persistence in RunPod
- **Size Optimized**: No models baked into image
- **Ready for RunPod**: Serverless mode with proper entrypoint

## Next Steps

1. Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set in your environment
2. Test build: `./scripts/test_build.sh`
3. Build and push: `./scripts/build_and_push.sh`
4. Configure RunPod with the pushed image from ghcr.io

## Environment Setup

The container will download models fresh on startup from HuggingFace Hub:
- SDXL: ~13GB download
- Flux: ~23GB download
- Models cache in `/tmp/` directories for session reuse

For persistent storage, use RunPod Network Volumes mounted at `/app/models`.
